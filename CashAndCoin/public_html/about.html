            <th>Collecting experience:</th>
            <td>I started collecting about 5 years ago. My collection started off with only a few coins and bills. The goal was to keep everything in pristine condition in order to avoid items that were damaged or fake. Since then my collection has expanded to contain various coins and bills throughout history and events. </td>

            <th>The Goal of this Site:</th>
            <td>My mission is to help individuals with trades so that they are able to complete their collection without the hassle of looking elsewhere. Over the last couple of months, I have received over 100 successful trades with the same individuals coming back for more.</td>

            <th>Site management:</th>
            <td>I am the only individual who runs this website and I am proud of how far it has come. The site is meant to look visually appealing to users so they feel comfortable when they are requesting to trade or looking through my collection. Currently, I am not looking for individuals to help me out.</td>

            <th>Trade Guarantee:</th>

            <tr>
            <th>How to find success:</th>
            <td>I believe that collecting is a very fun hobby and it does not have to include coins or bills. It can be anything that your heart desires. Be confident and smart when collecting and you will come very far from where you have started. I am always glad to see other individuals collections grow as does mine.</td>
